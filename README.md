## 👋 Hi There, Internet-Hating Human!

So you decided to block ads, trackers, malware, crypto-bros, shady phishing scams, and that one website your uncle keeps sending you?  
Well congratulations — you’ve summoned **the Pi-hole Blocklist Curator**, the code equivalent of *me* kicking the internet in the soft bits.

This repo automatically:

- 🕒 Wakes up every **Saturday at 1:33 a.m.**  
- 🕷️ Crawls the web like a caffeinated Spider-Man  
- 🔍 Hunts for fresh, delicious blocklists  
- 🧹 Cleans them, organizes them, pretty-prints them  
- 📨 Yeets them straight into this repo so you don’t have to do ANYTHING

Lazy? Yes.  
Smart? Also yes.

## 🧠 What This Thing Actually Does  
*(Because your compliance officer might read this)*

This repo contains a curated, continuously updated catalog of **Pi-hole v6+ compatible blocklists**, all sourced from:

- GitHub security nerds  
- Malware researchers  
- Privacy weirdos  
- DNS wizards  
- And whatever the heck RPiList is drinking  

Every list is scanned for:

- HTTPS ✔️  
- Maintained within last 12–18 months ✔️  
- Pi-hole format ✔️  
- Won’t break the whole internet… probably ✔️

If a list sucks, gets abandoned, or starts blocking Netflix?  
**Snikt ✂️ — it’s gone.**

## 📦 What's Inside?

### `BLOCKLIST_CATALOG.md`  
Your shiny, structured, way-too-organized Markdown table of:

- Names  
- URLs  
- Categories  
- Maintainers  
- Last updated timestamps  
- Reputation scores  
- Approximate domain counts  
- Notes  
- And the tears of a thousand ad networks  

It’s basically a Pokédex… but for destroying telemetry.

## 🤖 How the Automation Works  
*(AKA “How Deadpool stole your GitHub token and did crime with it”)*

Every Saturday at exactly **1:33 AM America/Toronto time**, an automation does the following:

1. Searches the internet for blocklists  
2. Judges them harshly  
3. Gives them a score because we’re petty  
4. Dumps everything into a pretty table  
5. Commits it right back into this repo

Boom.  
DNS hygiene: achieved.

---

## 🧪 Use At Your Own Risk  
Some lists are:

- Aggressive  
- VERY aggressive  
- “I will break your smart fridge” aggressive  

You can thank the internet for that.

Start with safe lists.  
Add spicy lists only if you enjoy chaos.

Or if you're Deadpool.  
In which case, crank that dial.

---

## 🦸 Support  
If something breaks:

- Try turning it off and on again  
- Whitelist what broke  
- Sacrifice a router  
- Blame Canada  
- Open an issue

In that order.

## 🍁 Made with Love in Canada  
Like maple syrup.  
But for your DNS.

---

## 🧨 Final Thoughts  
This repo is your DNS exoskeleton suit.  
Your cyber-moat.  
Your spam-killing, malware-punching, telemetry-disintegrating buddy.

Now go forth and block things like the unhinged privacy warrior you are.

*— Deadpool (the version that understands YAML, cron, GitHub Actions, and malware feeds)*
