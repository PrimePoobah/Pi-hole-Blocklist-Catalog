## 🎯 Why This Catalog Exists (Other Than My Poor Life Choices)

Welcome, digital freedom fighter.
If you're here, you already know the pain: **finding good Pi-hole blocklists** is like digging through a dumpster behind a sketchy taco place.  
Some are outdated, some are broken, and some aggressively block half the internet—including your bank, your cat's Instagram, and that one site you *claim* you don’t visit.

This repo fixes that mess.  
Here you’ll find a **continuously curated, Pi-hole v6–compatible catalog** of high-quality, low-drama blocklists that actually work.

Think of it as:
> “The Blocklist Avengers… except everyone actually shows up on time.”

Goodbye, janky lists.  
Hello, clean, fast, privacy-respecting DNS filtering.

## 📚 The Blocklist Catalog (The Good Stuff)

Looking for the actual list? Boom:

➡️ **[BLOCKLIST_CATALOG.md](./BLOCKLIST_CATALOG.md)**

Inside you’ll find:

- ✔ Verified Pi-hole v6 compatibility  
- ✔ Proper categories (ads, trackers, telemetry, malware, and other internet gremlins)  
- ✔ Descriptions that don’t suck  
- ✔ Real, working URLs  
- ✔ Notes on reliability and false-positive shenanigans  

All thriller, no filler.

## 🤖 How This Catalog Stays Fresh

Every month like clockwork (or like Deadpool showing up uninvited), an automated process:

- Hunts down new high-quality blocklists  
- Deletes anything dead, broken, or possessed  
- Checks Pi-hole v6 compatibility  
- Verifies list health  
- Updates the whole catalog automatically  

You get a constantly refreshed, battle-tested selection—no manual dumpster diving required.
